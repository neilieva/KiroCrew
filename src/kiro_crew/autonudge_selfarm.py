"""Authenticated record of which nudge loops a crew/member session armed ITSELF.

``NudgeLoop.self_armed`` is the one bit that relaxes the crew/member
external-arm refusal at fire time (``GatewayOrchestrator._fire_dashboard_nudge``),
and the loop store it lives in (``autonudge.json``) is agent-writable: an
agent -- or a prompt injected into one -- can write ``"self_armed": true`` on a
loop it did not arm from that session, and a restart would restore it. The
persisted bit alone is therefore not authorization; it is a hint that must
AGREE with a record the agent cannot forge.

That record lives here, in a GATEWAY-ONLY directory of its own,
``tag-grants/autonudge-trust/`` (:func:`self_arm_record_path`): a child of the
chat_tag grant store's root, chosen because that root is ALREADY a
whole-directory stand-in mask -- bind-masked by ``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``
and pre-created 0o700 before every spawn -- that holds every name inside it for
the namespace lifetime, present and future. A leaf masked at the data-home root
holds only the object present at spawn: a host-side atomic replace of that name
puts a fresh, writable object at the protected path for the rest of a running
namespace's life, which for an authorization record is the hole itself. Inside
the grant store's mask the record has no such window, its name reaches the
launcher payload as its own nested leaf (``tag-grants/autonudge-trust``, so the
hold is measured by ``test_sandbox_protected_name_holds``), and all three ways
of writing it are closed: the agent's file tools are fenced by
``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` (``tag-grants`` is prefix-matched, so the whole
subtree is fenced), a sandboxed shell -- a command that builds the path at
runtime, which no text matcher sees -- resolves inside the empty stand-in, and
no in-sandbox code opens it: only gateway code opening the path directly -- the
authorizer at the moment it admits an arm, the owner's switch, the store's
remove -- ever reads or writes it. The grant store's root is the right host
because it already holds owner authorization state of the same class (which
tags an agent may self-apply), is written by the gateway alone, and is never
swept or staged through; its own files stay siblings of this directory, never
inside it. NOT under ``trust/``: that directory is a declared sandbox READ-WRITE
exception (in-sandbox MCP servers append to the audit log there and
``verify_session_pid`` reads the SEL key), so a record under it stayed writable
by a same-UID sandboxed command, and an entry is the whole of an owner arm's
fire-time admission. A record an upgraded install still has at the ``trust/``
layout is DISCARDED on first access, not migrated
(:func:`_retire_legacy_record`): its entries may be the sandbox's, so the loops
behind them are refused until armed again. The fire-time guard admits a crew/member wake
only when BOTH hold: ``loop.self_armed is True`` on the record it loaded AND
``is_recorded_self_arm(loop.id, loop.slot_key)`` here. A forged bit with no
trust entry refuses; a stale trust entry with no bit refuses.

One flat JSON object ``{loop_id: {"slot_key": ..., "armed_ts": ...}}`` under a
SEAL: an HMAC over the entries keyed by the gateway's ``token_signing.key``
(:func:`_seal`), a secret every shipping build already masks from the sandbox
and fences from the agent's file tools. The directory mask above closes the
record to the sandbox from the boot that first masks it; it says nothing about
bytes planted at the same path BEFORE that boot, when the name was an ordinary
writable child of the data home. The seal does: a record this gateway did not
write under its current key cannot carry a valid seal, so a pre-upgrade plant
reads as nothing recorded (refuse) and is moved aside by the next writer
(:func:`_quarantine_unsealed_record`). A token-key rotation breaks every seal
the same way -- the safe side; the loops behind them are armed again. An entry
is written only by an authorizer. When its loop leaves the store, an owner entry
is revoked strictly and joined BEFORE the durable deletion; self-arm entries
retain post-commit best-effort cleanup. Thus a removed loop's id cannot retain
owner admission, while a failed owner revoke leaves the loop in place and a
failed store commit restores its admission. A write never prunes against a
caller-supplied view of the store -- see :func:`record_self_arm` for the race
that would open.
Every read-modify-write runs under an exclusive file lock so two concurrent
self-arms cannot drop each other's entries, with the record's host and its own
directory HELD open for the whole transaction (:func:`_hold_record_dir`): a link
at either name is refused by the open itself, never screened and then followed,
and the read, the quarantine and the publish inside address the record relative
to the held directory where the platform can. Every reader is TOTAL: a
missing, unreadable, malformed or unsealed file reads as "not recorded", which is the
refusing answer.

Blocking file IO throughout -- async callers offload via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

#: PER-SLOT LOCK for the owner's Perpetual mode on one member slot. Every
#: transition that pairs the arm record with the loop's state takes it: the
#: switch's mutations in ``handlers.members`` (identity re-check, loop re-read,
#: takeover, OFF's pause + revoke), the member's own ``autonudge_stop`` /
#: ``monitor_stop`` and its ``monitor_update`` cap check in
#: ``session_directive_apply``, AND the fire path's admission on a member slot
#: (``gateway._dashboard_mode_admits`` through turn publication). Without the
#: last one the timer could read the owner entry, lose the CPU to an OFF that
#: pauses the loop and revokes the entry, then publish a wake on a loop whose
#: authorization is gone; without the cap one the member could read "self-armed",
#: lose the CPU to a takeover that resumes the loop uncapped, then write a
#: finite cap onto the owner's loop. ``monitor_update`` of non-cap fields and
#: the service's own bookkeeping go through the nudge service's locks, not this
#: one. Process-local like the service. Entries are dropped once no holder or
#: waiter remains (``_PERPETUAL_LOCK_USERS``), so the map is bounded by the
#: operations in flight, not by the members ever touched. Lives HERE, next to
#: the record, because the gateway, the handler and the directive consumer all
#: import this leaf and none of them may import each other for it.
