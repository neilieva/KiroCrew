"""Bringing the two authority files back, before the backend can overwrite them.

## Why this runs before the backend and not beside it

``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are what turn a slot id back into a
conversation. The backend flushes them periodically from its own in-memory state, so
a backend that starts before they are on disk starts with an empty slot table and
then PERSISTS that emptiness over the restored files. The conversation list comes up
blank, the transcripts are still on disk, and nothing reports a fault.

So the restore is not "early for speed". Finishing before the backend starts is the
correctness rule, and this function is called from the supervisor's startup order
where that is enforced, not from the sidecar, which does not exist yet at that point.

Transcripts are deliberately NOT restored here. The front fetches the one transcript
a turn continues, on that turn, which keeps the property that a task only ever holds
the conversations it has itself served. Downloading them all at boot would undo that
and would need a bucket listing, which the front's reader cannot do.

## Why the bytes are validated before they are written

Both of the backend's own readers ignore an authority file they cannot parse and
carry on with an empty result. That is right for them and wrong for this step: a
malformed object written here would be read as "no conversations" and then replaced by
the flush, so the restore would look like it worked and the customer's list would be
empty. Refusing to boot instead turns a silent loss into a message an operator gets
before the task serves a turn.

The check is exactly as strict as those readers require -- the file must be a JSON
object, and ``open_slots.json``'s ``keys`` must be a list if it is present -- and no
stricter. A schema invented here would refuse a file the backend would have accepted.

## What an existing local file means

It is kept, and it is READ before it is kept. Nothing has started, so a file already at
the path did not come from this boot's backend: it came from a data home that outlived
the task, and that copy leads the bucket by up to one backup interval. Overwriting it
would roll a conversation list backwards. ``link_new`` makes that a filesystem guarantee
rather than a check.

Keeping it is not the same as trusting it. The same reading the bucket's bytes get is
applied to the local file, because the backend loads whichever copy is on that path and
loses it the same way -- so the branch that skips the write must not also skip the check.
A local file that would be read as no conversations refuses the boot, rather than being
replaced by the bucket's copy: replacing it would roll the list backwards, while a
refusal leaves both copies where an operator can repair either. That reading also covers
a name the bucket holds nothing for, since a file there boots the backend whether or not
anything was restored over it.

    safer state than a file that does not parse -- it is the same loss arriving quietly.

    A refusal is the recoverable choice and an acceptance is not, which is what settles
    every case here. Refusing leaves the bytes in the bucket for a repair to read;
    accepting spends them. That is also what separates this from refusing an authority
    file the bucket never held: there, a refusal protects nothing, because there are no
    bytes behind the absence.

    *origin* says WHERE these bytes came from, because the same reading is applied to two

    consecutive pointerless cycles can land complementary halves into the same slot, because
    a failed pair PUT leaves the half that succeeded behind and the next cycle -- still
    pointerless, so still targeting the same slot -- can fail on the other half.

    Coherence is not a claim that every open tab appears in the session map. An open tab with
    no ``session_map.json`` entry is an ordinary state, not a torn one: ``_persist_open_slots``
    lists every persistent slot that finished construction, while ``session_map.json`` gains an

    every replacement boot -- no cycle runs after the refusal to publish the pointer it waits
    on, the unrecoverable outcome ``_uncommitted_generation`` exists to avoid.

    Nor can a tab bound to the wrong conversation reach the backend through these files. The

    name boots empty or is skipped, never corrupt.

    So the one property establishable from the bucket alone is that each half is a readable
    index -- a JSON object, not a truncated or wrong-shaped write. That is weaker than

    """Fetch, validate and write both authority files. Raise if any of it fails.

    The pair is read from the COMMITTED generation and from nowhere else. A pointer object
    names the slot whose pair was published whole, a writer publishes into the other slot,
    and commitment is that one object -- so a publication interrupted halfway damages only
    a slot this function never looks at, and there is no state in which half a commitment
    is visible.

    Six cases, each decided here. No pointer: the generation slots are surveyed first, and a
    slot holding a COMPLETE pair is adopted -- the pointer is written last so a generation is
    whole before anything references it, which makes that pair a real publication and a newer
    one than the legacy keys. Refusing it instead would be unrecoverable: this runs before the
    sidecar starts, so no cycle would be left to publish the pointer a refusal waits for. With
    no complete slot pair the legacy keys are generation 0, and an authority file absent there
    is absent rather than torn -- unless a slot holds that very name, which is a pair torn
    before it was referenced and refuses, naming manual repair. A pointer whose generation
    holds every name it
    was committed with: the ordinary restore. A pointer whose generation is missing one of
    those names: refused, because that pair lost a member, and the next complete cycle
    republishes into the other slot and commits it, which repairs the bucket. A pointer
    present but unusable: refused, since unusable is not absent. A bucket with only legacy
    keys: generation 0 again. A bucket with legacy keys AND a committed generation: the
    pointer wins and the legacy keys are ignored, because they are the older publication.

    A read that fails for any OTHER reason is failure too, including a denial -- reading a
    denial as absence is the same route to booting with an empty slot table.
