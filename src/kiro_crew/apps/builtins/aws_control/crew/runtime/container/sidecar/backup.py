"""One backup cycle: what must be durable, and how each object is copied.

## What is in the set

Three kinds, and the set is a definition rather than a filter, so "was this file
backed up" has an answer that does not depend on what the directory happened to
hold:

1. **The two authority files**, ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json``. They
   turn a slot id back into a conversation, so without them the transcripts are on
   disk and the conversation list is empty.
2. **Every live transcript**, the ``.jsonl`` files directly under the sessions
   directory. One per conversation this task has served.
3. **Every archived segment** under ``sessions/archive/``. Rotation moves the older
   part of a long conversation there and the container never reads it back -- the
   front's fetch may not list, and finding a segment requires listing -- so these are
   uploaded for the owner's control plane, which has credentials of its own. Leaving
   them behind would be silent loss of the older half of every long conversation.

Anything else under the sessions directory is not in the set. The front writes a
temporary file there while fetching and unlinks it itself, and a name that is
neither that nor a transcript is not a conversation.

## What order they go in, and why the order is a correctness rule

The transcripts go first and the authority files last, in their own phase. The
authority files are the INDEX: a replacement reads them to decide which conversations
exist, and the front then fetches each named transcript lazily. So an authority table
newer than the transcripts it names points at objects that are not in the bucket, and
the front reads an absent transcript as a conversation with no history -- a live
conversation served empty, with nothing raised anywhere. The opposite skew is
harmless: an authority table older than the transcripts names only slots whose bytes
are already there, and a transcript it does not name yet is unreferenced rather than
misread.

Which is why the authority files are OPENED first, before a single transcript is
listed, and sent from those descriptors at the end. Opening fixes the instant a file
describes, so the pair is one coherent snapshot of the index taken before the
enumeration it indexes. Reading them at send time instead let a slot table flushed
during the cycle name a transcript that cycle never listed.

That rests on the backend publishing both files the way it publishes a transcript, a
temporary file and a rename, which leaves an open descriptor addressing the whole
previous version. It does: ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are both written
through an atomic replace. A writer that truncated one in place instead would take the
snapshot property away without changing anything here, so it is pinned by a test rather
than left as an assumption.

The authority phase is SKIPPED when the transcript phase suffered a refusal a LATER
CYCLE COULD GET PAST -- a failed upload, an object the drain window could not fit, a
directory missing right now. Publishing it then would advance the index past bytes this
cycle failed to write; withholding it leaves the pair at the last cycle that completed,
which is older and coherent, and the next cycle publishes a pair the bucket supports.

It is NOT skipped for a refusal decided by an entry's SHAPE -- a symlink or a FIFO where
a transcript belongs, a linked archive root. Withholding is a WAIT, and every later cycle
meets that entry too, so the wait never ends: the index would freeze at the moment the
entry appeared while transcripts kept uploading past it, and the next replacement would
restore a conversation list predating every conversation served since. The cycle is still
incomplete and the entry is still named; see :class:`RefusedEntry` for the split and for
the bounded residue it accepts in exchange.

One residual remains in the pair itself. The two files are two PUTs, so a failure
between them leaves the bucket holding one from this cycle's snapshot and one from an
earlier cycle's. Both were opened before this cycle's enumeration, so neither names a
transcript that is absent, and the failure raises rather than passing quietly; the cost
is one interval in which the two files disagree about which slots exist, which the next
cycle resolves.

## How one object is copied

``open_snapshot`` opens the file ONCE and records the length that descriptor's file
had at that moment. The upload then sends exactly that many bytes from that
descriptor. Three properties follow, and they are the three constraints this design
has to hold at the same time:

* **Consistent** without a lock. The backend publishes a transcript with a temporary
  file and a rename, so it never writes into the bytes behind an open descriptor --
  it swaps the directory entry to a different inode. A descriptor opened before the
  swap keeps addressing a whole, finished version, and a file that is appended to
  instead is uploaded as the prefix that existed at open time, which is also a
  version that was really on disk.
* **Bounded** on disk. Nothing is copied first. A cycle spends one descriptor and one
  fixed transport buffer per object, so an oversized artifact cannot fill the
  filesystem the app is writing to.
* **Nothing dropped.** There is no size at which an object is skipped. An entry that
  genuinely cannot be uploaded is recorded and the cycle ends by RAISING
  :class:`BackupIncomplete` -- after uploading everything it could, so one bad entry
  does not cost every other conversation its backup.

## Every shape an entry can have, and what happens to it

## What the fingerprint is for, and what it is not

Change detection is a COST decision, not a correctness one. The fingerprint is the
inode, the length and the modification time as they were at open, and an object is
re-uploaded whenever it differs from the one last uploaded successfully. It lives in
memory, so a restarted sidecar re-uploads everything once: paying for a full cycle is
the right way to be wrong here, and persisting the state would put a second authority
on disk to keep in agreement with the bucket.

    The root is opened with every link refused BEFORE anything under it is listed, for the
    reason the archive root is: ``os.scandir`` resolves the path it is given, so a link
    planted at ``sessions/`` is followed and its target's files are listed as this task's
    transcripts. Each one is then refused on the way down -- :func:`_open_within` walks from
    the data home with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and raises at the ``sessions`` component -- so the
    cycle uploads nothing while every refusal is a per-ENTRY one. Listing through the link
    and refusing afterwards is what turns a replaced root into an index that names
    conversations whose bytes are not in the bucket.

    A root refusal WITHHOLDS the authority pair, and unlike a per-entry refusal it does so
    whatever its cause. The residue :class:`RefusedEntry` accepts is one planted NAME among
    transcripts that are otherwise reaching the bucket, where freezing the index for all of
    them is the worse trade. A refused ROOT is the whole tree: nothing is reaching the
    bucket, so an index that advances describes a state the bucket does not hold at all,
    and the pointer staying at the last complete generation costs nothing that was going to
    be uploaded anyway.

    *budget* is the seconds the caller's deadline gate set aside for this object, handed to

    gate reserves a window the transmission is free to overrun, which is the one way an
    object is lost rather than reported: the drain SIGKILLs the process in the middle of a
    PUT, so that object and every object after it go with no record of which.

    *cancel* is what an interval cycle hands over instead. It has no window to reserve, so
    it has no budget to pass; the predicate is how its upload is still ended the moment the
    stop arrives, rather than after a transmission that has no bound at all. Neither is a
    permanent failure, so a cut upload is recorded as this cycle's refusal and re-attempted.
