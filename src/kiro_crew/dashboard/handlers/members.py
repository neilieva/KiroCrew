"""Crew Members HTTP handlers — roster and per-member DM thread binding.

The Crew Members page talks to each crew member in one durable, pinned DM
thread. The thread's slot key is DERIVED (``member-<slug>``) and its binding
lives in the member's own space (``members/<slug>/dm.json``), so the mapping
survives restarts independently of the slot layer's own persistence.

Member slots are born ONLY here, with ``mode="member"``: the generic slot
create endpoint's ``_CREATABLE_MODES`` deliberately excludes it, and the
frontend's chat-ownership predicate (``isChatPageSurface``) does not admit it,
which is what keeps member threads out of the ordinary Sessions list with no
filtering code anywhere.

Dashboard-only surface: app tokens are denied outright (deny-by-default, same
posture as slot access — an app has no business enumerating the user's crews
or opening threads that speak as them).

    What the detail drawer mounts on. The roster list carries only the view a list
    ROW paints; the drawer paints the activity timeline, the patrol state and the
    driven-slot list, and it is open for exactly one member at a time, so it reads
    them here instead of every row carrying three views nothing on it reads.

    Serves the WHOLE snapshot rather than a named subset: the drawer reads three
    views today, the projection set is extensible (an app contributes its own
    ``<app>/<name>`` key), and a per-key allowlist here would silently withhold a
    view the moment one is added. The block is the same shape the roster ships and
    the same shape a ``member_projection`` frame carries, so the client seeds it
    through one code path.

    ``member`` (query, REQUIRED) is the exact crew name, for the same reason the
    activity read requires it: a slug is a lossy fold, two names can share one log,
    and a whole-member projection served on the wrong name renders one member's work
    as another's. The name is checked against the log's own header, and a mismatch
    answers 409 rather than a blank body -- the drawer has to be able to say WHY it
    is empty.

    A member with no log answers an empty BASELINE (``asOfSeq`` 0, no values),
    which is exactly what the roster sends for the same member, and the read does
    not create one: opening a drawer is not an event in that member's life. The
    negative sentinel is kept for a slug that cannot be attributed, because the
    client stops applying live frames to those and a member about to be written
    about for the first time must keep receiving them.

    Redacted through the projection chain before it leaves, the same as the roster

    Feeds the Crewmates page panel's Notes tab. The briefing
    (``members/<slug>/briefing.md``) is the crewmate's self-maintained standing
    notes — an AGENT-written file, curated by the crewmate for its future self.
    This endpoint reads and never writes, and the panel offers no editor for
    the file: the dashboard's file viewer reads through a redacting path and
    its Save writes the buffer back, so any in-dashboard edit of an
    agent-written file could replace a secret the crewmate wrote in the
    meantime with its placeholder. The notes are edited where the crewmate
    writes them, outside the dashboard.

    The text comes from :func:`members.read_member_briefing_bounded` and
    inherits its total contract: a missing or unreadable file reads as ``""``
    (the normal state of a fresh crewmate — never a 404), and content past
    ``MEMBER_BRIEFING_MAX_CHARS`` is cut at the cap with a visible marker
    (:func:`members.cap_member_briefing`, applied AFTER redaction so the cap
    cannot split a token past the patterns), which the panel renders as-is so
    the human sees the same overflow the crewmate is shown. ``supported`` is :func:`members.member_briefing_supported`:
    on platforms without ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and the pinned ancestor walk the read
    fails closed to ``""`` and the panel explains that from the flag rather
    than presenting an empty briefing as "no notes yet". ``updated_ts`` is the
    file's own mtime (epoch seconds) or ``null`` when there is no file.
    ``redacted`` and ``truncated`` each say the wire text shows less than the
    file holds (a secret replaced by its placeholder; a tail past the cap not
    shown), so the panel can say so above the notes instead of leaving
    placeholders and a marker unexplained. A successful read leaves a SEL row
    (``members.briefing.read`` / ``allowed``), as the rules read does.

    ``member`` (query, REQUIRED) is the exact crew name, same posture as the
    activity endpoint: slugification is lossy, and the exact name is echoed
    back so the frontend keys its cache by name rather than by a slug two
    crewmates can share -- and, as on the rules endpoint, the exact name must
    derive this slug, exist, and be the ONLY crew that derives it: the briefing
    is one file per slug, so for a colliding slug the notes belong to neither

    """OWNER TAKEOVER of a stopped member loop, as one transaction.

    Runs inside the supervised mutation task, under :func:`_perpetual_lock`
    for *slot_key*; the caller has established that *existing* is the slot's
    loop, inactive, and not a structured monitor. Because the task is
    shielded from the request, no step here is interrupted by a client going
    away; the sequence runs to its end and decides on what it saw.

    Steps: read the entry's current party with the STRICT reader (an
    unreadable or malformed record is indeterminate and refuses the takeover);
    emit the critical owner-arm audit before authorization changes; rewrite the
    entry to ``owner`` stamped with THIS takeover's token (skipped when it
    already says owner: nothing changed, nothing to restore); resume the loop
    with its caps lifted and its cycle accounting kept; decide on the update's
    FINAL RESULT -- the loop the awaited service call returned, never the
    in-memory record, since the service rolls its fields back when the persist
    fails and only the returned value reflects what was written.

    Rollback: on a refused resume or a raised one (the service has rolled its
    own state back by then), the entry is put back to the prior party -- but
    only if it still carries this takeover's token, so a later takeover's
    entry is never overwritten by an earlier one's cleanup. A CANCELLATION of
    the task (gateway shutdown) has two shapes. Before the resume is issued --
    during the joined owner-entry write -- the outcome is certain (the loop is
    still stopped), so the entry is restored to its prior party, joined, and
    then the cancel propagates: an owner entry over a loop the UI shows OFF
    would be the whole admission for a forged ``active: true``. During the
    resume itself the outcome is unknown at the moment of the cancel -- the
    service shields its persist and may still commit -- so the resume is issued
    as its OWN task and the cancel WAITS for it to settle (re-shielded across
    repeat cancels), then reads the store: a loop that resumed keeps its owner
    entry (it is now a running owner arm); a loop that did not is put back to
    its prior party, token-keyed and joined, before the cancel propagates. An
    owner entry left over a loop that never resumed would otherwise be the
    same forge-usable state as the pre-resume case. One entry per loop, one
    party per entry: see ``record_owner_arm``.
