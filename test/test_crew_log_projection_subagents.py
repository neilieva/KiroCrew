"""The ``subagents`` fold -- one test per property it promises.

The fold answers one question from one savepoint read: which children this session
dispatched, and for each one its outcome, its duration and what it cost. The
properties worth pinning are the ones a reader would otherwise have to trust:

* a closer lands on its own row, and nowhere else;
* a closer with NO row is still counted, because crash-repair writes one for a child
  whose ``spawned`` fell past the retention cap, and dropping it would under-report
  what the session actually spent;
* ``totals.spawned`` counts every dispatch, while ``by_id`` holds only the retained
  ones -- so the two disagree by ``omitted``, on purpose;
* absent credits are never read as zero, which is the same posture ``usage`` takes.
