"""Perpetual mode: the dashboard OWNER arms a member's own loop from its detail page.

A member-mode slot refuses every arm that did not come from its own turn. The
owner's Perpetual mode switch is the second admitted party: it is granted only
on the owner-gated ``POST /api/members/{slug}/perpetual`` route, recorded in
the keystone-gated trust record under its own ``armed_by``, and honoured by the
fire-time guard for MEMBER slots only. It never claims to be a self-arm.

Pinned here:

(a) TRUST RECORD -- an owner entry and a self entry are disjoint: each reader
    vouches for exactly one party, and an entry without ``armed_by`` reads as
    self (the only writer that existed before the field).
(b) AUTHORIZER -- ``owner_arm=True`` admits a member slot with an
    ``owner_armed`` audit, writes the owner record before the add, never sets
    ``self_armed``, is refused on a crew slot, and is a no-op flag on an
    ordinary slot. Without the flag a member slot is refused exactly as before.
(c) FIRE GUARD -- a member wake with a recorded owner arm is admitted; a crew
    wake is not; a forged ``self_armed`` bit cannot ride an owner entry.
(d) ROUTE -- owner-only; slot key derived from the binding; ON arms with
    unlimited cycles and runtime, ON on a stopped loop resumes it and lifts its
    caps, OFF pauses (record kept, reason ``manual``), a structured monitor is
    never converted, a finite loop elsewhere is untouched.

Every test patches ``sel`` so nothing is written to the real security log, and
the trust record against a temporary data home.
