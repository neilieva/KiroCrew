/**
 * One crewmate's Perpetual mode, read for the two places its switch sits: the
 * detail page (the crew editor's Schedules pane) and the Crewmates page side
 * panel.
 *
 * Perpetual mode is the crewmate's restart policy: ON, it keeps waking on its
 * own thread with no cycle or time cap; OFF, it works only when asked. The
 * reading here is assembled from two queries the dashboard already keeps live:
 *
 * - the roster (`GET /api/members`) names the crewmate's slug, the slot key its
 *   own thread is bound to, and its `perpetual` reading (`on` / `off` /
 *   `none`) -- the editor knows the crew by NAME only, and a slug is lossy (two
 *   crews can share one), so the row is matched on the exact name and nothing
 *   is re-derived here. The STATE is the roster's word: the backend computes it
 *   from the same registry with `is_structured_monitor_loop` applied, so a
 *   structured monitor on the crewmate's thread -- which `/api/autonudge`
 *   publishes as a reduced row with no cycle accounting -- reads `none`, never
 *   ON, and the switch never offers a change the route would refuse (409);
 * - the loop registry (`GET /api/autonudge`), filtered by that slot key, for
 *   the READOUTS an ON or OFF state carries (interval, wakes, last / next
 *   fire, the stop reason and words). The websocket hook invalidates
 *   `AUTONUDGE_LOOPS_QUERY_KEY` on every `autonudge_state` frame and on
 *   reconnect, so a stop or a wake re-renders without this hook listening for
 *   anything; the interval is a floor under that for a dropped frame. The
 *   roster is re-read when the registry changes for the same reason.
 *
 * A roster row from a server that predates the `perpetual` field falls back to
 * the record itself (active = on, present = off, absent = none). `failed` is
 * kept distinct from "no loop" so a read that failed is never rendered as the
 * affirmative "never turned on".
